# Yahtzee – Game Explanation

Yahtzee is a fun dice game for 2 or more players where players roll dice and try to get combinations to get the highest score. To play the game, start by rolling all 5 dice. You can keep your roll as is, re-roll all the dice, or save some of the dice and re-roll the rest. You can roll a total of 3 times per turn.

# Our Game

You start the game by login in or creating an account. This is important for the high score list. You have a button to roll the dice. After rolling, you can click on the numbers to lock them and click again to unlock them. You click roll the dice up to three times. Then you must decide what combination that is and set the score to this combination by clicking the corresponding button. If you choose a combination that does not work, the program asks you if you would like to put a zero there. The game ends after you have a score next to every combination.

We built in a database so there is a high score list. But as the database is only local, you can’t play with your friends online. The “Hall of Fame” shows your username, your best high score, the number of games you played and your average score and is sorted descending by high score.
